# Title of the Project

# Smart Expense Assistant: An AI-Based Approach to Expense Control and Wealth Creation

## Small Description :

The Smart Expense Assistant is a desktop-based application designed to help users efficiently track, analyze, and control their daily expenses while improving savings through intelligent insights and budget monitoring.

## About :

Smart Expense Assistant is an AI-based expense tracking system developed to simplify personal finance management. Traditional expense tracking methods rely on memory, manual notes, or limited mobile applications that often ignore offline and cash-based expenses. This project overcomes these limitations by providing a unified platform where users can record both online and offline expenses, set category-wise budgets, and monitor savings effectively.

The system uses heuristic and statistical analysis techniques to study user spending behavior and generate meaningful insights. With a simple desktop interface and offline data storage, the application ensures privacy, usability, and reliability while supporting better financial decision-making.

## Features :

1. Manual entry of online and offline expenses

2. Category-wise expense tracking and budget limits

3. AI-based spending analysis and savings suggestions

4. Visual reports using pie charts and monthly trends

5. Reminder alerts to avoid overspending

6. Offline data storage with high security

7. Simple and user-friendly desktop interface

## Requirements :

* Operating System

* Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10 / 11 (64-bit)

* Development Environment

* Python 3.8 or later

* Programming Language

* Python

* Database

* SQLite (Local Storage)

* Libraries and Tools

* Tkinter – GUI Development

* Matplotlib – Graphs and Charts

* OpenPyXL – Excel Export

* ReportLab – PDF Report Generation

* IDE

* Visual Studio Code

## System Architecture :

* The system architecture follows a modular desktop-based design.
* User expense data is collected through the Tkinter interface and stored securely in a local SQLite database.
* The AI-based analysis module processes the data to identify spending patterns, budget usage, and savings trends.
* The results are visualized using charts and reports, and reminders or suggestions are generated to guide the user toward better financial control.
